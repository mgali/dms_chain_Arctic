Instructions for binning Takuvik chain data.

Done with code bin_nc_month_reproject.m or bin_nc_ndays_reproject.m. Calls:
	repbin_grid1_grid2.m
	summary_stats.m
	*list*.txt with all daily *PP.nc files avaialble on Takuvik servers
 	(should be in same folder)

	* Note that on 30-Sep-2016 bin_nc_month_reproject.m replaced bin_nc_month_28kmfill.m. The old file was no longer updated.

Climatological means calculated with bin_nc_*CLIM.m. Calls:
	summary_statsCLIM.m

May require...
	- Updating the list of Takuvik chain files (e.g. AM_list.txt) used to test for file existence prior to making operations.
	- Updating paths to: input files (Takuvik chain, grids, bathymetry)
	- Removing summary*.txt files from directory.
	- Commenting-uncommenting lines where type of output (*.nc vs. *.txt) is chosen.
	- Editing main code (bin_nc*reproject.m) to choose years, n-days periods, variables, output name format (yyyyddd vs yyyymmdd)
