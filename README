Instructions for binning Takuvik chain data.

Done with code bin_nc_month_28kmfill.m or bin_nc_ndays_reproject.m. Calls:
	repbin_grid1_grid2.m
	summary_stats.m
 	(should be in same folder)

May require...
	- Updating the list of Takuvik chain files (e.g. AM_list.txt) used to test for file existence prior to making operations.
	- Updating paths to: input files (Takuvik chain, grids, bathymetry)
	- Removing summary*.txt files from directory.
	- Commenting-uncommenting lines where type of output (*.nc vs. *.txt) is chosen.
	- Editing main code (bin_nc*.m) to choose years, n-days periods, variables, output name format (yyyyddd vs yyyymmdd)
