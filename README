Instructions for binning Takuvik chain data.

1. Binning
==========
Spatial and temporal binning from daily 4.6 km (MODIS) or 9.2 km (SeaWiFS) done with code:
	bin_nc_ndays_reproject.m (n-days periods, typically 8D), or
	bin_nc_month_reproject.m (monthly periods)

Spatial binning outputs averages of 6x6 (~28km, current default), 8x8 (~37 km) or 10x10 (~46 km) MODIS macropixels. The two binning codes listed above call the following codes, which should be on the same directory:
		repbin_grid1_grid2.m (which does the spatial binning given a list of indices matching grid1 and grid2).
		summary_stats.m (which optionally outputs some stats for the chosen variable(s)).

	* Note that on 30-Sep-2016 bin_nc_month_reproject.m replaced bin_nc_month_28kmfill.m. The old file was no longer 
	updated.


Edits needed
————————————
Running the code on your computer may require...

- Updating the list of input files (eg AM_list.txt, SI_list.txt) used to test for file existence prior to making operations. A function to do this within the code may be included in future versions.
- Updating paths to: input files (Takuvik chain, grids, bathymetry)
- Removing old summary*.txt files from directory if they have been created on the same day (to avoid appending new data on pre-existing file).
- Editing lines where output file (*.nc versus *.txt) and date (yyyyddd vs yyyymmdd) formats are chosen.
- Editing main code (bin_nc*reproject.m) to choose years, n-days periods, variable names, variables that produce summary stats (var4stats).


2. Climatologies from binned data
=================================
Climatological means can be calculated with:
	bin_nc_ndaysCLIM.m, or
	bin_nc_monthCLIM.m

Which in turn call
		summary_statsCLIM.m

Update list of input variables, as above


3. Gap-filling
==============
Done with codes:
	dmspt_fill.m (for DMSPt products)
	danyvar_fill.m (for any other variable)

Codes are identical, only output (filled) variable names differ. Both scripts call:
		find_paths_4fill.m

This script searches the paths of files used for filling up gaps in a given file. It outputs four paths: those of the prior and posterior 8D file, and those of the corresponding 8D and monthly climatology. Gaps are filled hierarchically by
	1) Interpolating temporally between prior and posterior 8D periods
	2) Filling remaining gaps with 8D climatology
	3) Filling remaining gaps (if any!) with the monthly climatology

Data used for gap-filling correspond always to same sensor and product(eg Aqua, chl_gsm).

* Script may fail if it does not find one file needed for gap filling I assumed all 8D and monthly files were available.
